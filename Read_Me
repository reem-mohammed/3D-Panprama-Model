Project Introduction (overview):

My University panorama site is a web site which made to new students of faculty of computers and information (FCI) who don’t know the system of the faculty, or don’t know anything about faculty places or its buildings, teaching assistants and doctors’ rooms. 
As we know that new students who come to the faculty of computer and information (FCI) don’t know anything about the faculty system .Most of students don’t know exactly the place of faculty or its places like, labs, new building, and other class’s .New students don’t know anything in the faculty about its courses and departments. Students may be faced problems to contact the staff of the faculty so it will be easy through our site. 
If the student is at the first year he can know all information required about the faculty, his/her doctors and his /her teaching assistants.
FCI panorama site provide a new chance to new students to know (classes)places lectures by panoramic flashes which show all( faculty places )places that included in the faculty not places of lectures and sections only so student can know every place of the faculty before entering it.
Also visitors can watch whole faculty before visiting through panoramic flashes. 
The user doesn’t need any registrations to enter the site so the user can enter the site easily at any time.
The user may be: new student, visitor, student wants to ask about course and doesn’t know faculty places of the faculty place.
So he /she will enter the site and watch the main map flash then enter the faculty 3D MAX model of the faculty and choose the place he want to see its panorama by clicking the building model he can see place flash and the related flashes to the building for examples the labs of new building 
The user can make search by entering building name which will appear in the map and choose it and watch its flash, the additional thing that after the user see the place he/she want the path of the chosen place will appear
User after choosing the panorama he want to see he can see some buttons which reach him to the information of the place he choose 
Also FCI panorama site has some links to some places of the faculty like faculty library, scientific calculus centre and statistics institute.
Our solution is a good way to help student be familiar with his faculty and to know a lot of information about it before entering the faculty.

---------------------------
Problem statement (Problem Space Definition):

New students who come to the faculty of computer and information (FCI) who don’t know anything about the faculty system
Most of students don’t know exactly the place of faculty or its places like, labs, new building, and other classes
New students don’t know anything in the faculty about its courses and departments. 
Also students who want to take courses and don’t know where to reserve that courses or where the course will be token in our faculty.
Visitors who will visit the faculty for the first time who don’t know the faculty place or the buildings of the faculty so they can enter our site and know faculty place in the map and all faculty buildings 

------------------------------
Scope:
Our scope is designing and implementing a website that interacts with the students who are new to the faculty and wants to explore it by watching the whole faculty without visiting it through our panorama view.
 Also visitors can watch our faculty through the panoramic flashes so they can determine the place they want to visit.
So the main scope of our site is to increase the feasibility and flexibility.
Students will be able to (have the first priority in our site)
	•	Learn about the education of the faculty through seeing faculty places.
	•	Watch video of any place of the faculty
	•	See place of doctors and TAs offices so they can contact them 

Visitors will be able to:
	•	See whole panorama of faculty. 
------------------------------                                                                    
1.4 Lifecycle model:
System Development Life Cycle:
 The System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a conceptual model used in project management that describes the stages involved in an information system development project from an initial feasibility study through maintenance of the completed application.
 Mostly, several models are combined into some sort of hybrid methodology.
 Documentation is crucial regardless of the type of model chosen or devised for any application, and is usually done in parallel with the development process. 

Some methods work better for specific types of projects, but in the final analysis, the most important factor for the success of a project 
may be how closely particular plan was followed.
Briefly on different Phases: 
---------------------------------------------------
Feasibility :
The feasibility study is used to determine if the project should get the go-ahead. If the project is to proceed, the feasibility study will produce a project plan and budget estimates for the future stages of development. 
Requirement Analysis and Design 
Analysis gathers the requirements for the system. This stage includes a detailed study of the business needs of the organization. Options for changing the business process may be considered.
 Design focuses on high level design like, what programs are needed and how are they going to interact, low-level design (how the individual programs are going to work), interface design (what are the interfaces going to look like) and data design (what data will be required).
 During these phases, the software's overall structure is defined. Analysis and Design are very crucial in the whole development cycle. Any glitch in the design phase could be very expensive to solve in the later stage of the software development. Much care is taken during this phase. The logical system of the product is developed in this phase. 

 Implementation 
In this phase the designs are translated into code. Computer programs are written using a conventional programming language or an application generator.

In our site we used a lot of languages like:
ActionScript,php and mysql.
And used a lot of programs like:
 zend studio for eclipse, wamp server, macromedia flash player, 3Dmax, adobe photo shop, macromedia dream weaver, panorama maker 4.

 Testing                              
In this phase the system is tested. Normally programs are written as a series of individual modules, these subjects to separate and detailed test. The system is then tested as a whole.
 The separate modules are brought together and tested as a complete system. 
The system is tested to ensure that interfaces between modules work (integration testing), the system works on the intended platform and with the expected volume of data (volume testing) and that the system does what the user requires (acceptance/beta testing). 


Maintenance 
Inevitably the system will need maintenance. Software will definitely undergo change once it is delivered to the customer. There are many reasons for the change.
 Change could happen because of some unexpected input values into the system. In addition, the changes in the system could directly affect the software operations.
 The software should be developed to accommodate changes that could happen during the post implementation period. 
The waterfall model is sequential software development process, in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like waterfall) through the phases of Conception, Initiation ,Analysis ,Design (validation), Construction and testing 


Advantages of Waterfall Software Development
	•	It is very easy yet powerful method of software development. The phases are arranged so that it helps even the new developers to understand the “big picture” of how to go about developing the software through the software development life cycle.
  •	It calls for a disciplined approach to save on project time and cost as well effort. Otherwise the implementation team may develop a code only to realize later that it was not at all required. This happens much more than one might realize and it cause issues both in development and testing.
  •	The project management stakeholders are forced to correctly define the business requirements documentation (BRD) and the project management requirements. At the sometimes the developers are forced to understand these Thoroughly before they start writing the software requirements specification (SRS), high level design and code
  •	It essentially requires documentation at every stage. This gives better understanding of the requirements, the logic of the codes and tests that were conducted on the software.


 
Disadvantages of Waterfall Software Development
	•	In this method, all the requirements of the software need to be specified upfront and there is no room for committing mistakes.
  •	The project scope statement needs to be detailed in infinite depth from the start because changes are not possible when using waterfall methodology. This is because the only way to amend something which has been already developed is to go back and start again. This will cause huge problems on projects where the project sponsors are indecisive and quickly causes scope creep.
  •	Key team members stay idle for long durations. You see Waterfall does not operate on a matrix basis which makes project resource management an extremely rigid activity. Basically those allocated to the project stay on it until that phase is over. This as you can imagine, has a direct knock on effect on the project budget.
  •	It is a very rigid method which does not entertain any change in requirements and which makes any subsequent functionality changes required extremely difficult and expensive to implement. As such the fast pace of changing requirements determined makes this methodology difficult to use and calls for more nimble methods of 
  •	Software development such as agile methodology or SCRUM methodology.
Assumptions
1.5.1 All users who are students or visitors have the system requirements either software requirements or hardware requirements that indeed required.
1.5.2Users has no difficulty in filling any forms in the site

System Definition
The Project Name: FCI Panorama
It’s site  to the faculty of computer and information that have different idea ,it’s idea about having a tour around the whole faculty showing all places inside it like the main entry, gardens, all labs that make visitors in between them .
At the first page our site provided with a map that will show where the place of our faculty from any other place that is very interesting idea to all students. when the user enter the site he /she will find a map of Cairo and Giza, Then it will take the user closer and closer then to the Cairo university then to faculty of computers and information where the user can choose place which he want to watch.

A simple description of how the user will use the site
Firstly:
The user doesn’t need any registrations to enter the site so the user can enter the site easily without any restrictions.
Secondly:
The user may be:
1-new student
2-visitor
3-student wants to ask about course and doesn’t know faculty places of the faculty place.
So he will enter the site and watch the main map flash then enter the faculty 3D MAX model of the faculty and choose the place he want to see its panorama by clicking the building model he can see place flash and the related flashes to the building for examples the labs of new building 
Thirdly:
The user can make search by building name which will appear in the map and choose it and watch its flash , furthermore he/she can show model of students that walk through the faculty to show the actual path to the place wanted.

Fourthly:
User after choosing the panorama he want to see he can see some buttons which reach him to the information of the place he choose              

Chapter 2
Fci panorama system

Objectives:
The main objective is to achieve the collaboration between new students who never know any information about their faculty of computer and information (FCI) and want to know about faculty places that lead us to make design with flash pictures to show places and take a tour around the whole faculty to satisfy viewing it at all. This is also for visitors of the faculty. 

•	System Goals
Effective to use (effectiveness).
Efficient to use (efficiency).
Easy to learn.
Easy to remember.
High speed in saving and accessing.
Make new students familiar with their new faculty .

                                

The system is built for:
Students:
New students who come to the faculty and don’t know anything about places or faculty entire, labs, new building, and other classes. He can know also doctors and teaching assistant’s rooms.
Student who wants to take courses at the faculty and people want to know information about the faculty and place they will take the course.
Visitors of the faculty who don’t know faculty place or faculty buildings.


System Requirements
First the meaning of system requirements :these are the necessary specifications that user' computer must have in order to use the new software, so any one use the software for his/her own computer should check and make sure that his/her computer support the system requirements .

Problems which faced our team during project period:
1-In Connect images together to make panoramic pictures:
In this step our team found a lot of problems
We decided to use panorama maker to make panoramic pictures then put it in macromedia flash but when we begin to capture the image we faced problems like the following:-
1- Faculty places are Disgruntlement unlike Panoramic places which must be wide to make good panoramic pictures which make a lot of problems during capturing.
2-there is a lot of differences in lights in the faculty places which make differences in light effect that make pictures so bad and make no eye contact.
3-we find a lot of students everywhere so we faced problem to ask these students to empty the places 
4-we choose late hours in order to comply with the panoramic camera so that the light is properly distributed
5-as the Disgruntlement of the places of the faculty and the bad lights the pictures is hard to be made on panorama maker program so we are forced to use Photoshop program to collect our panoramic pictures which also is very hard and took a very big time






It is an example for a picture that made by panorama maker:



It is the same picture after editing in photo shop program:








2- Connecting panorama with database:
 it is the most difficult and important stage in our site first the main idea in this flash is if the user click on any flash in the site it must show all data in the database that stored about it 
For example: if user clicks on lab 7 he/she must see the following
 1-the panorama flash which round 360 degree of the lab
2-the data related to the lab like the number of PCs or any other data (capacity)
3- The information about each place for example the teaching assistant rooms will contain information about the names of teaching assistant and their office hours .

The problem in this step: 
The way we connect the database to flash begging from “action Script” in flash program to relate the flash with mysql
And as we say before this technology is to some extent new and take a lot of effort to have those ideas of connecting action script with php and mysql
3- Make a map: 
We think about new students who wants to know the exactly place of the faculty without visiting it so we make a map which content from a flash this flash content of shots to globe zooming In  and zooming In to reach to Cairo and Giza map then zooming In  and zooming In to reach to Cairo university, then zooming In and zooming In to faculty of computers and information 3D MAX map to the faculty then go to choose any place needed to showing inside the faculty.
The problem of this step:
 The 2d matrix not helps us in the design as we want to illustrate all parts in the faculty as in the real-world 
The solution assigned to this problem is that: 
We design the map using “3d MAX” to be more obvious. Which take also a lot of time and effort? 
The problems we faced in designing the 3D MAX map are that:
  There is no one in our faculty using this technology of 3DMAX program so we go to faculty of engineering to Architecture department who use 3D MAX program and asked about how to use this program then we made the map 
So our site uses a 3DMAX technology in the map of the faculty our team spends a big effort in this step like:
1-we used Google earth to find our faculty map, we preferred to put globe to reach the user to Cairo and Giza map then our faculty map in 3D model
2-after we have our faculty map from Google earth we determined to make this map in 3D model to make our map to be more expressive to the reality
3-we found that we need 3D MAX program and begin to ask how to use that program as it isn’t used in our faculty
4-so we went to faculty of engineering to have program source and ask about how to use program tools so we went to faculty of engineering more than one time
5-we found that we must use a scale in our map which is each 2 cm in Google map is 4 cm in 3D MAX map
6-so we need the building form to began to design it in 3d model so we begin to take photos of each building and Corridors of the faculty from all dimensions
7-then we began to design it in the 3d MAX program. 
 

Future work
Our site can be improved or extended by that if this idea found admiration of students and visitors, it is possible to implement the whole Cairo University as this idea can make for the whole university for new students and visitors. It can make for the all faculties of the Cairo university it can also make for university theater, university library an all important places for Cairo university. It also can execute for all Egypt universities with all faculties so any overseas students from outside Egypt can choose the university which they want to belong to it.
